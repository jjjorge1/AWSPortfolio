                                        <p>I used Python flask to create a small forum style app. Anyone can post any kind of text

                                            is no fron-end the main focus was the back-end.

                                            like every other Login page you must register your Login name and Password. Both will be stored 
                                            in a Database where the app will compare what you typed in the login fields vs what is stored in the Database.
                                            This is also mainly focused on the back-end.

                            <p>I studied computer science at the University of South Carolina as well as Japanese.
                                After graduating university I moved to Japan where lived for six and a half years.
                                When I first moved to Japan I moved to a small city called Soma in Fukushima Prefecture.
                                I taught as a junior highschool english teacher. I lived in Soma for one and a half years. 
                                After Soma I moved to Osaka, one of the largest cities in Japan. I worked as a junior highschool
                                English teacher, private English school teacher, and a Kindergaten teacher. I lived in Osaka for five years.
                                After Osaka, I moved back to the United States. After moving back I found a position as a production control and 
                                purchasing specialist at a Japanese company called Sekido Technology Corporation.

                                    <p>When I was in Japan. My friend and I would go Hiking once a week up a local mountain in Osaka. The trail we took would lead us to a 
                                        genuine mountain spring. The water would actually come out of the mountain. The water was super delicious.
